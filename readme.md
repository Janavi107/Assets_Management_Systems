ASSETS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

PROPOSED SOLUTION

Data may power the energy industry's modern digital transformation. The data
collection procedure frequently involves too much redundancy. Workers must continually
collect the same data due to outdated protocols so that it may be entered into different data
management systems. Such processes aggravate employees by diverting them from their
primary task of caring for assets. Even if storing records on paper is not the most dependable
technique, many businesses still use pen and paper. Workers are required to convert data
across formats as a result. This is time-wasting and raises the chance of making mistakes.In
the utilities sector, data issues might also take different forms. Companies that have
implemented digital transformation occasionally find themselves drowning in data from an
excessive number of assets. We can rectify this problem by Asset management system, it
collects from surrounding consumers or machines directly using CAN communication
technology. This can be developed into an app using advanced data structures and
blockchain, which reduces many accidents and difficulties due confusion faced by workers.
This can also be implemented in fintech and e-commerce.
